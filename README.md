A AntiFlood package for Pyramid
===============================

This package help to prevent user from performing an action many times on an item for
a time period. Each time the action occured, the counter will increase by 1. There're a
limited value for each action, so a LimitionReachedError will be raised if this
value is reached.

This package use Redis as storage to store counter values.

Usage
-----

    ```python
    import pyramid_antiflood

    antiflood = pyramid_antiflood(action_id, item_id)

    try:
        antiflood.verify()

        action_occured = is_action_occured()

        if action_occured:
            antiflood.increase()
        else:
            antiflood.clear()

    except pyramid_antiflood.LimitionReachedError, e:
        # TODO process on limition is reached
        print e
        pass
    ```
